# Startup-SBOM Project Contribution Guidelines
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Startup-SBOM project! We greatly appreciate your help in making our vulnerability analysis tool even better. Below are some guidelines to start your journey as a contributor.

- Testing and Reporting Errors
    - One of the most valuable ways you can contribute is by testing the code thoroughly.
    - Identify any bugs, errors, or unexpected behaviour you encounter during your testing.
    - When reporting an issue, please provide clear and detailed steps to reproduce the problem.
    - Include any error messages, relevant log outputs, or screenshots that can help us understand and fix the issue.
- Proposing Improvements
    - We encourage you to suggest improvements that can enhance the functionality, performance, or usability of the Startup-SBOM project.
    - When proposing an improvement, please clearly explain the significance or importance of the suggested change.
    - Focus on the "why" rather than the "what." Could you explain how the improvement will benefit users and make the project better as a whole?
    - Feel free to share your ideas informally, as if you were explaining them to a friend.
- Keeping the Existing Codebase Intact
    - As you contribute, please ensure that your changes do not break any existing functionality.
    - Avoid introducing new issues or regressions into the codebase.
    - Before submitting a pull request, double-check that your changes do not conflict with or duplicate any existing code.
    - If you need guidance or have questions about the existing code, don't hesitate to reach out for clarification.

## SPECIAL NOTE
If anyone has any ideas on how to incorporate other package managers or further improve the functionality please share your views or work on a PR or in the discussions.
