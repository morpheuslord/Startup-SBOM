# Security Policy

The **Startup-SBOM** project is designed as a simple and lightweight tool for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for startups and small-scale projects. While the focus is on **DevOps best practices** and maintaining **clean and modular code**, this project does not adhere to stringent security standards due to its simplicity.

## Scope of Security
This project is not intended for high-security environments or mission-critical systems. It serves as a proof of concept or a utility for learning and development purposes. Users should not rely on this project for production systems where security is a top priority.

### Key Points:
- **DevOps Focus**: The project emphasizes automation, version control, and CI/CD principles to streamline workflows.
- **Clean Code**: Efforts have been made to keep the codebase simple, readable, and modular for easier understanding and contributions.
- **Low Security Standards**: 
  - No advanced encryption or security measures are implemented.
  - Vulnerabilities may exist due to the minimalistic approach.
  - Users are advised to use this tool in controlled or isolated environments.
