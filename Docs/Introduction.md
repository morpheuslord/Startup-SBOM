# Startup SBOM

The objective of the project is to examine the startup process and establish connections between all the packages that initiate during boot and the corresponding services associated with them. The project aims to ensure clarity regarding the execution of packages and executables, as well as their potential impact on the system. This effort is particularly valuable for streamlining the investigation process in reverse engineering vulnerable packages.

## Process Overview

**CHROOT Analysis:**

The CHROOT analysis feature of the tool involves a comprehensive examination of the systemd boot process within a CHROOT environment. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:

1. **Execution Procedure:** The tool initiates the CHROOT analysis by executing the `systemd-analyze` command within the CHROOT shell environment.

2. **SVG Output Parsing:** It captures the SVG output generated by `systemd-analyze` within the CHROOT shell. This output contains valuable information about service files and their respective startup times.

3. **Data Extraction:** The tool meticulously extracts relevant data from the SVG output, focusing particularly on service files and their associated startup times.

4. **Graphical Representation:** Utilizing this extracted data, the tool then proceeds to graphically plot the service files and map out their startup times. This graphical representation offers a visual overview of the systemd boot process within the CHROOT environment.

5. **Detailed Documentation:** For further insight and reference, detailed documentation regarding the CHROOT analysis feature is provided, outlining its functionalities, usage instructions, and potential applications.

**STATIC Analysis:**

The STATIC analysis functionality of the tool encompasses two distinct methods: `service` and `info`. Here's a detailed elucidation of each method:

1. **Service Method:**
   - **Basis of Analysis:** This method utilizes the `.service` files located in the `/lib/systemd/system` directory as the foundation for conducting static analysis.
   - **Procedure:** The tool systematically parses through these `.service` files, extracting relevant information pertaining to service configurations, dependencies, and other pertinent details.
   - **Analysis Output:** The output of this analysis provides insights into the systemd services configured on the system, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of their functionalities and interdependencies.

2. **Info Method:**
   - **Data Source:** In contrast to the service method, the info method leverages the `.list` files located in the `/var/lib/dpkg/info` directory for conducting static analysis.
   - **Analysis Scope:** By analyzing these `.list` files, the tool gathers information regarding installed packages, their associated files, and related metadata.
   - **Insight Generation:** The output derived from this analysis offers insights into the installed packages on the system, their components, and relevant configuration details.
